Restoring a classic car(70s & 80s) can be as complicated as solving a 1000 piece puzzle blind folded or as easy as putting a few pieces of Lego together. It all depends on your experience and the work you’re planning to do.
To restore a car successfully it requires careful planning, plenty of research, setting a timeline and deciding if you’re going to do it all or source some professionals.
With the new norms of fuel economy, fuel consumption has to be closely analysed while adding components. Factors like weight of vehicle, no. of cylinders in engine and acceleration on power decide the fuel consumption.
Here is an ML model trained on AutoMPG dataset that can predict fuel consumption based on a few relevant factors.

## Machine Learning Model
* Framework : Scikit-Learn( Version: 1.0 )
* Algorithm : Support Vector Regressor
* Validation Accuracy : 85.3%
* Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg

### How to train
Upload the python notebook in the folder **'model'** to Google Colab and run each cell for training the model.
## How to use:
* Clone repository to local machine and run app.py in folder web app or open https://heart-status.herokuapp.com/ to take a quick look.
* You can make changes in app.py and web-app folder and host it to use as an api in any application.
